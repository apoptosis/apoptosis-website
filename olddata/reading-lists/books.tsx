        author: ["kris-borer"],
        desc: `<i>The Ethics of Anarcho-Capitalism</i> is my favourite libertarian book, if I could reccommend only a single book to goldpill a person this would be it. It is a narrative non-fiction book about libertarianism. It combines praxeology and storytelling to develop ethics in a way that is simple, robust, and fun.

Whether you want a clear introduction or a more advanced understanding, this book will shed libertarianism in a new light.

Here’s what others are saying:

<blockquote>
This is an excellent book on anarcho-capitalism. It covers all the bases, and then some. This is an enjoyable read, an easy read, and at the end of the road lies real insight. Five stars.
</blockquote>
—Walter Block, author of <i>Defending the Undefendable</i>

<blockquote>
I was dreading reading this, but it is conceptually excellent.
</blockquote>
—Michael Malice, author of <i>The New Right</i>

<blockquote>
This book uses praxeology to define libertarianism based on the non-aggression principle. Ancaps may find the implications disconcerting, or illuminating.
</blockquote>/i
—Stephan Kinsella, author of <i>Against Intellectual Property</i>

<blockquote>
For those who enjoy going deep into libertarian theory, the thought experiments and strategies in this book will prove valuable.
</blockquote>
—Jakub Bozydar Wisniewski, author of <i>Libertarian Quandaries</i>`
