Anarcho-Capitalism",author:["kris-borer"],desc:"<i>The Ethics of Anarcho-Capitalism</i> is my favourite libertarian book, if I could reccommend only a single book to goldpill a person this would be it. It is a narrative non-fiction book about libertarianism. It combines praxeology and storytelling to develop ethics in a way that is simple, robust, and fun.\n\nWhether you want a clear introduction or a more advanced understanding, this book will shed libertarianism in a new light.\n\nHere\u2019s what others are saying:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis is an excellent book on anarcho-capitalism. It covers all the bases, and then some. This is an enjoyable read, an easy read, and at the end of the road lies real insight. Five stars.\n</blockquote>\n\u2014Walter Block, author of <i>Defending the Undefendable</i>\n\n<blockquote>\nI was dreading reading this, but it is conceptually excellent.\n</blockquote>\n\u2014Michael Malice, author of <i>The New Right</i>\n\n<blockquote>\nThis book uses praxeology to define libertarianism based on the non-aggression principle. Ancaps may find the implications disconcerting, or illuminating.\n</blockquote>/i\n\u2014Stephan Kinsella, author of <i>Against Intellectual Property</i>\n\n<blockquote>\nFor those who enjoy going deep into libertarian theory, the thought experiments and strategies in this book will prove valuable.\n</blockquote>\n\u2014Jakub Bozydar Wisniewski, author of <i>Libertarian
