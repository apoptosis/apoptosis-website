# Introduction
Apoptosis is a community built around the motto of "co-edification through tinkering, dialectic and reference." Through this goal we engage in frequent debate over controversial topics, and in communal contribution to [projects](https://github.com/apoptosis) with this in mind.

# Motivation
**Apoptosis** is a cellular-biology term meaning:
> The death of cells which occurs as a normal and controlled part of an organism's growth or development.

We use it as a metaphor to mean something like:
> The death of beliefs which occurs as a normal and necessary part of earnest participation in dialectic.
